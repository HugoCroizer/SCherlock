# SCherlock: Single-Cell marker gene identification algorithm

## Overview

SCherlock is a statistical algorithm for identifying cell type-specific marker genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data. The algorithm uses probabilistic models to identify genes that are specifically expressed in target cell types but not in other cell types, making them reliable markers for cell type identification.

## Features

- Statistically rigorous marker gene identification
- Support for multiple cell types and patient samples
- Theoretical and empirical validation of marker predictions
- Flexible scoring methods to prioritize sensitivity or specificity
- Visualization tools for marker gene evaluation
